Here's a breakdown of the next steps:
Start with integrating Tone.js: Focus on integrating the Tone.js library into your codebase. Ensure that you can load and save musical compositions using the library's functionalities.
Interface the code with the user interface (UI): Connect the UI buttons and controls with the underlying code, allowing users to interact with the editor and generate musical notes.
Build the notes array: Implement functionality that captures the musical notes played through the UI buttons and stores them in an array or data structure.
Implement save functionality: Develop the ability to save compositions using the notes array. This will allow users to save their work and retrieve it later.
Explore Web MIDI integration: Consider integrating Web MIDI to support MIDI keyboard or other device inputs. This will enhance the editor's versatility and allow users to interact with the application using external MIDI devices.
Refine and expand features: Once you have the core functionalities in place, you can focus on refining the output, formatting options, and generating PDFs or other desired output formats.
By following this step-by-step approach, you can gradually build the Laughing Abe editor's capabilities and ensure a solid foundation for future development.


Laughing Abe Music Editor Roadmap
This roadmap outlines the key steps to enhance the Laughing Abe Music Editor by incorporating MIDI functionality, load/save capabilities, and improving the playback feature. Following these steps will allow users to enjoy a more comprehensive and versatile music editing experience.

Roadmap Steps:
Integration of Tone.js/Midi:

Add the Tone.js/Midi library to the HTML file. You can either link it remotely or download the script and include it in the libraries folder.
Refer to the library's documentation and examples to understand its usage.
Implement Load Functionality:

Utilize the createFileInput() function from p5.js to create a load file button.
Retrieve the filename from the file input and pass it to the Tone.js library to load the MIDI file.
Map the structure of the loaded MIDI file to your existing sound mapping for playback.
Enhance MIDI Playback:

Establish the necessary interface between the loaded MIDI file's structure and your sound mapping.
Ensure seamless playback of MIDI notes within the Laughing Abe Music Editor.
Develop Save Functionality:

Create an array to store MIDI data that users can manipulate within the editor.
Implement the save feature to enable users to save their compositions as MIDI files.
Further Improvements:

Explore additional features and enhancements, such as formatting output for various purposes like generating PDFs or other printable resources.
Consider incorporating webMIDI functionality to enable MIDI input from external devices like MIDI keyboards.
Please note that this roadmap provides a general framework for developing the Laughing Abe Music Editor. Feel free to adapt the steps according to your specific requirements and the needs of your users.

We encourage collaboration and welcome contributions from the developer community. Let's work together to create an engaging and intuitive music editing experience with the Laughing Abe Music Editor!
